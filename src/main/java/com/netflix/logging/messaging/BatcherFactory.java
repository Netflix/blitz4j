/**
 * A simple singleton factory class that finds the batchers by name. Batchers are also created by the factory if
 * needed. The users of the batcher have to simply override the {@link com.netflix.logging.messaging.MessageProcessor}
 * to specify what to do with the batched messages.
 * 
 * It is the user's responsibility to make sure the name is unique (ie) a FQCN would be ideal for a name. The user
 * should also remove the batcher from the cache during shutdown or when they do not need it.
 * 
 * The methods are not synchronized for performance reasons and there is very little downside of not synchronizing it
 * as the last put wins and the already existing objects are garbage collected.
